# GUVI Contact Form Clone
This project creates a clone of the contact form that is available on the GUVI home page (guvi.in).

The data entered through the form is sent to an API hosted on the mockapi.io platform. The data is stored in the form of array of key-value collections.

The form is created using HTML, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript.

To open form, open the index.js in a web browser.
